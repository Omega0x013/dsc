## Foreword

This is meant to be an absolute technical guide to the Deep Stone Crypt, not an exploration of the lore. It is meant for people who want to understand in depth how the encounters work and best practices and callouts. You should have completed it several times and be interested in teaching it for this to be useful to you. This was written by `Omega0x013` in conjunction with the expertise of #1 Sherpa `iAthanasia`.

**Sidenote**: I have ADHD so it is very likely that I will not complete this fully. I'm very open to improvements so if you want to add something please make a PR and I'll try and have a look.
